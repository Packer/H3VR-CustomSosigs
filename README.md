# About
The Custom Sosig Loader is a system designed for easy sosig creation and importing into H3VR, working in conjunction with the [Custom Sosig Editor](https://github.com/Packer/H3VR-CustomSosigs/releases) sosigs can be easily created within a matter of minutes with visual feedback on what the sosigs will look like and even provides a way to screenshot your newly made sosig for the Supply Raid Editor or sharing. This mod only serves as a sosig loading library.

# Usage
*NOTE: The Custom Sosig Loader in its current state only has partial support for making Sosigs for TnHFramework, see [Wiki](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/Packer/SR_Defense_Valley_Fort/wiki/) for more infomation*

Custom Sosig Loader has support for any Atlas scene, Sandbox and Supply Raid. Check out the [Wiki](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/Packer/SR_Defense_Valley_Fort/wiki/) on instructions on getting started.
